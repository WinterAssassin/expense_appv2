# expense_appv2

This a version 2 of my expense tracker app. This app tracks user spending. Add a new expenses, shows it in a list tile with the title, amount and date of transaction. A chart at the top portion shows the
percentage of each spending on each categroy(food, leisure, travel, work). User can also delete expenses by swipin each list tile left or right.
